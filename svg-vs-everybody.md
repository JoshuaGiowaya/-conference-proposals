# SVG Vs Everybody

### Abstract

### Description
In this talk we will discuss the why, when, and how of implementing SVG's (Scalable Vector Graphics) in your project. At code42, we decided to exclusively use SVG's for iconography and logos across all our production websites. I will share what we learned throughout this process, the use cases, edge cases, best cases, and worst cases. Also, we will take a in-depth look at anatomy of an SVG. Finally we will compare capabilities SVG vs .png, CSS, JavaScript. You will leave this talk excited and prepared to implement SVG's in your next project.
